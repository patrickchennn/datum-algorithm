    what is dynamic progamming?
Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a given complex problem by breaking it into subproblems and stores the results of subproblems to avoid computing the same results again.

the key is: 
complex problem 
--> break it into subproblems
--> stores the results of subproblems

why we need to stores the results of subproblems?
because, we want to avoid computing the same results again.

    memoization recipe:
1. Make it work.
-make it work first, it could be slow but that's okay, because we are looking for correctness in out solution even though it slow/TLE
-visualize the problem as a tree
-implement the tree using recursion
-test it

2. if it works then make it efficient.
-add a memo object/dict/hashmap
-add a base case to return memo values
-store return values into the memo

note:
1. Don't solve it quickly all in one go, it should be a separate process(make it work first then optimize it)

    recursion tip:
try to think about your recursive functions in terms of tree. I.E. try to VISUALIZE it
